By Renata Teixeira, Zhi Li, Reenal Mahajan, and Wei Wei On January 26, 2026, we flipped an important switch for Live at Netflix: all Live events are now encoded using VBR (Variable Bitrate) instead of CBR (Constant Bitrate) .

VBR lets us tailor the bitrate to the actual complexity of the scene, instead of sending every second of video at roughly the same bitrate.
